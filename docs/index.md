# Astrocook üç™

A thousand recipes to cook a spectrum
{: .fs-6 .fw-300}

Astrocook is a software environment to analyze quasar spectra. It includes:
* a set of **algorithms** to model spectral features in emission and absorption (continuum, spectral lines, complex absorption systems);
* a graphical user interface (GUI) to perform the analysis **interactively**;
* a scripting utility to **automatize** the analysis and make it fully **reproducible**.

This site serves as a documentation for [Astrocook v1.0.0](https://github.com/DAS-OATs/astrocook). It shows how to [get started](start.md) with the software and its GUI, how to [manage the data](data.md), and how to [perform some common tasks](common.md). It also provides a [reference of the recipes](cookbook.md) available in the code.

The documentation is still sparse, but is constantly improved. An ‚ùóÔ∏è highlights an important feature, or sometimes an issue of the code that is going to be solved in the next future. A üöß denotes a section of the documentation that needs to be completed.
