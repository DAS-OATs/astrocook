## Spectrum table

This is an example of spectrum table:

![Spectrum table](img/table_spectrum.png)

The fundamental columns are:
- `x`: the wavelength-like independent variable;
- `xmin`, `xmax`: the interval in `x` values in which the flux-like quantity is integrated;
- `y`, `dy`: the flux-like dependent variable and its error.

The interval [`xmin`, `xmax`] is also called a *bin* (because it is the unit into which the flux information is binned) or a *pixel* (because in some cases it maps to a physical pixel in the spectrograph detector).

Other columns that frequently appear in a spectrum are:
- `y_conv`: a convolution of `y` with some smoothing kernel;
- `lines_mask`: a boolean mask of the detected lines (see [below](structures.md#list-of-lines));
- `cont`: the spectral *continuum*, i.e. the component of `y` that remains after removing local features (e.g. absorption lines) and smoothing out noise;
- `model`: a spectral *model*, i.e. a model of both the continuum and the absorption systems (see [below](structures.md#list-of-absorption-systems);
- `deabs`: a *deabsorbed* spectrum, i.e. an equivalent of `y` after the absorption lines have been removed using the model;
- `resol`: the spectral resolution at `x`;
- `fit_mask`: a boolean mask of the regions used to fit the model of the absorption systems.  


## Line table

The information to populate the table columns is directly extracted from the [spectrum](structures.md#spectra) where the lines have been detected:
- `x`: the line center, corresponding to the `x` value of a pixel in the spectrum;
- `xmin`, `xmax`: the boundaries of the interval covered by the line, also corresponding to the `x` values of two pixels in the spectrum;
- `y`, `dy`: values of `y` and `dy` at `x` from the spectrum;
- `source`: column of the spectrum that was used to detect the line.

Please note that in this case [`xmin`, `xmax`] do not map to a single pixel in the spectrum, but to a range of pixels.

Lines are not typically detected on the raw `y` column of the spectrum, because in general the noise on `y` makes it very hard to discriminate between legitimate lines and random fluctuations. This is the reason for keeping track of the `source` of the detected lines. A typical `source` value is `y_conv`, i.e. a convolution of the `y` column of the spectrum with some smoothing kernel (see [above](structures.md#spectra)) but it may be any other column.


## System table

When you detect absorption systems, they are also formatted into a table added to the session. The table contains the information to model the absorption systems:
- `func`: the function used to define the model (currently, only the Voigt function `voigt` is available);
- `series`: the list of ionic transitions that are modeled;
- `z0`: the starting redshift, typically computed from the `x` value of one or more [absorption lines](structures.md#list-of-lines);
- `z`, `dz`: the redshift of the model and its error;
- `logN`, `dlogN`: the base-10 logarithm of the column density used in the Voigt function (in cm^-2) and its error;
- `b`, `db`: the doppler parameter used in the Voigt function and its error;
- `resol`: the resolution adopted by the model;
- `chi2r`: the reduced chi-squared between the model and the data;
- `id`: the identification number of the model.

The parameters of the [Voigt profile](absorbers.md#voigt-profile-modeling) (`z`, `logN`, and `b`) may be either guess or fitted parameters. As a rule, when a system is added to the list it is also fitted to the spectrum: `z`, `logN`, and `b` are the best-fit values and `chi2r` gives an estimation of the goodness of fit.

## Interact with the data

Table cells are editable. If you click on a cell and edit its value, the new value is propagated to the underlying data structure.

By right-clicking on the column labels, you can:
- Sort the table by ascending or descending values of the chosen column;
- Produce a histogram of the values of the chosen column (which appears on a separate window).

By right-clicking on the row labels, you can remove rows from the table.
